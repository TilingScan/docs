# Create new project

By clicking on Create new project, you can upload the data files needed to use TilingScan.

You must provide the following information:

- **Project title**: this will help you to differentiate projects.
- **Project author**: your name.
- **Annotation file**: File containing the genome annotation of the organism of study **(See data formats)**. 
- **Experiment type**: You can select your experiment type by providing strand-specific (e.g. GRO data) or non-strand specific data (e.g. ChIP-on-chip data).
- **Experimental data files** **(See data formats)**:
  - **Forward file**: file with expression of the Forward (Plus, Watson) strand.
  - **Reverse file**: file with expression of the Reverse (Minus, Crick) strand.


**TIP**: You can upload every file compressed in a .zip file.

After selecting you data files, click on <b>Create!</b> to upload them to the server. The size of this type of files is usually large, so this process may take a few minutes. 

Once the upload is complete, an automatically generated identifier will be assigned to your project (**Project ID**). You may want to save this ID for future access to it via the project home. 
Alternatively, you can search for it by providing the application with either the project or the user name.


**IMPORTANT NOTE**: You can create an unlimited number of projects, **but every project will only be available over 60 days**. Sixty days after the date of creation **the project will be automatically deleted**.

# About TilingScan

TilingScan is a WebApp for the analysis of differentially expressed DNA regions in tiling microarray data in a strand-specific manner.

TilingScan can load data from tiling array results as genome graphs, which display probe intensity alongside the genomic sequence, aligning it onto the reference genome provided by the user. 

It allows customized visualization of either specific chromosomes or specific genes of interest.

By uploading data sets that reflect the ratio between two experimental conditions, peaks and valleys of intensity display differentially expressed regions. 

Along with their visualization, TilingScan provides the user with a tool to accurately locate and identify these regions, recording useful information such as their chromosomal coordinates, length, and mean intensity value on each DNA strand. 

All images, tables and results provided by the application can be downloaded for further analysis.

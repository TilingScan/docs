- **Project search**: Here you can search for all the already existing projects that you have previously created. By introducing the Project ID, project name or the name of the author all uploaded data sets will be displayed.
- **Create new project**: Opens the page where you can upload your data to create a new project.  You can give it a name and save it. TilingScan will also provide your new project with an automatically generated identifier (Project ID).
- **Try the app**: If you do not have any data sets yet, you can try all the app features with demo data.
